# 2D PID Controller for autonomous boat

Two-dimensional proportional–integral–derivative controller for a boat, tracking both its angle and speed. Includes a GUI that simulates the movement of the boat in response to the controller, to collect items on the water. This project is part of a bigger project in Télécom Paris, where the goal was to create a small autonomous boat to collect floating waste.
